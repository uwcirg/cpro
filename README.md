"cPRO" (http://cprohealth.org)  is an open-source "computerized patient-reported outcome" software product.  cPRO projects together comprise a series of flexible web-based, interactive, domain-specific health assessments and interventions, built on a common platform developed to support research and clinical projects over the last decade. Our efforts have led to the development of a platform that is unique in meeting the needs of patients, clinicians and researchers. Approximately 30-40 cPRO systems have been deployed for use by clinical and research teams domestically and internationally.

This is a CakePHP 2.3 web application.
