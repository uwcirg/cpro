PLEASE NOTE: The code here is quite out of date; we maintain the main trunk in a non-public subversion repository and don't yet have a process to keep this github repo appropriately updated. The basic framework is relative unchanged, but there have been many refinements and feature additions. If you're interested in learning more about the latest code, please contact mcjustin@uw.edu or lober@uw.edu.

"cPRO" (http://cprohealth.org)  is an open-source "computerized patient-reported outcome" software product.  cPRO projects together comprise a series of flexible web-based, interactive, domain-specific health assessments and interventions, built on a common platform developed to support research and clinical projects over the last decade. Our efforts have led to the development of a platform that is unique in meeting the needs of patients, clinicians and researchers. Approximately 30-40 cPRO systems have been deployed for use by clinical and research teams domestically and internationally.

This project has adopted the PHPDoc standard for API docmentation. (http://www.phpdoc.de/) A configuration file for the doxygen API generator can be found under app/doxygen and a generated version of the documentation is included in this repository under app/docs/phpdocs.

This is a CakePHP 2.3 web application.
